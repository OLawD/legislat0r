# Legislat0r

An open source system for crowdsourcing creation and analysis of legislature.  Inspired by [Free Internet Activism] and [this discussion about crowdsourced legislation software](http://www.reddit.com/r/fia/comments/swu5r/please_take_a_minute_and_read_legislation_20/).

## Problem this software addresses

> [...] There are two key dimensions that shape the input legislators receive during the drafting process: barriers to entry and incentive. Lawmakers only hear from people or groups when their incentives overcome the barriers. Typically, barriers to entry are high -- organization, money, and lobbyists are required -- so incentives must be high as well. Thus, those with strong incentives (read: the industry) overcome those barriers. - [theatlantic.com](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/can-we-harness-the-internet-to-collaboratively-write-better-laws/253445/)

## Goals of this software

The goal of this software is to get people involved in the creation and analysis of legislature by lowering the barriers to entry and increasing the incentive to participation.

The software should be used to explain, analyse, adjust and interconnect legislation that is already in existence.  During that process it should educate the users to allow them to provide more meaningful help and better understand the legislation of their country.

## Guiding Principles

* The barriers to entry should be low for ease of participation
* There should be incentives and recognition for participation
