legislat0r
==========

An open source system for crowdsourcing legislature by taking advantage of social networking.

It was inspired by the [Freedom of Internet Act](http://www.reddit.com/r/fia) - Please see this [reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/fia/comments/swu5r/please_take_a_minute_and_read_legislation_20/) also.

We are currently gathering requirements.  If you have an idea about what or how the system should do something please post to the [issues](https://github.com/hamstar/legislat0r/issues).  You may also want to checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/hamstar/legislat0r/wiki).
